    "\n",
    "Ollama is a local tool that lets you run large language models (LLMs) on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "kind of like ChatGPT, but fully offline and private.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports models like: llama2, mistral, gemma, phi, llava, etc.\n",
    "- Works on macOS and Linux (Windows support is improving via WSL).\n",
    "- Uses optimized quantized models (like GGUF) for fast local inference.\n",
    "- Built to be simple: ollama run llama2 runs the model in seconds."
